# Manifest // CorecraftGenesis

**Audit-Sealed Archive of Modular Mythology**  
This repository curates symbolic, reproducible artifacts from the Genesis and Chain2025 mythos.  
Each Echo, Manifest, and Poster is a narrative anchor — dignified, annotated, and ready for integration.

> *“Infrastructure is not neutral. It remembers.”*
